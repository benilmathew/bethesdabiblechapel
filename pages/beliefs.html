We believe that there is only one living and true God, and that He eternally exists in three persons: the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit, our Creator, our Redeemer and our Sanctifier.</p>

He was begotten of the Father through the Holy Spirit, born of the Virgin Mary, and is true man without ceasing to be God. He was sinless, died on the cross as a perfect sacrifice for our sins, was buried, rose bodily from the dead, ascended into heaven, and now intercedes as our High Priest.</p>

                                <p>Being dead in our trespasses and sins, we are unable to help ourselves and cannot be delivered from this dreadful state except through the unmerited grace of God our Savior. Every man and woman is totally deprived and needs a Savior.</p>

                                <p>As members of Christ's body, we should devote ourselves to collective Worship, the study of God's Word, fellowship with the saints, remembrance through the Lord's Supper, and prayer.

                                <p>We believe in the imminent return of our Lord Jesus Christ to take his Church out of this world, before the great tribulation. Those who die in Christ before His return shall be made perfect in holiness and go home to the Lord. When He returns, we shall be raised in glory and made perfectly blessed in the full enjoyment of God to all eternity.</p>
                                <p>We believe in the return of Christ for the Millennium reign, after the tribulation. After the Millennium reign, all those whose name is not found written in the Book of Life will be judged at the great white throne and cast into the lake of fire.</p>

                                <p><strong>Elders:</strong> We believe that the Scriptural pattern for spiritual oversight of the local church is through plurality of elders. An elder should be a person of maturity, who can take responsibility and leadership, and can protect, lead, and feed the flock. Elders are appointed by the Holy Spirit and recognized by the local church.</p>

                                <p><strong>Worship Service:</strong> We have an open worship service where the entire congregation is actively involved in the worship of God, through Jesus Christ and led by the Holy Spirit. Men of our congregation are free to represent us in worship through praise, scripture reading, hymns, exhortation, or prayer.</p>

                                <p class="mt-20"><strong>Baptism:</strong> The New Testament presents Baptism as an act of obedience whereby a person publicly identifies with the Lord Jesus Christ in His death, burial, and resurrection. We believe that baptism should be by immersion, administered only to those who profess faith in Christ.</p>
